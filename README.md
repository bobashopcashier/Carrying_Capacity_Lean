# Lean formalization of carrying-capacity mean-field models

**Status: partial formalization, with checked proofs and an explicit boundary.**
This project formalizes definitions and proof components from both
[DeWitt, Evans, Hiesmayr, and Hummel (2024)](https://arxiv.org/html/2307.06010v2)
and Kenny Xie's *Mean-Field Limits for Multitype Birth–Death Systems with
Unbounded Moment Feedback*
([manuscript source](https://github.com/bobashopcashier/Carrying_Capacity_fixed/blob/c7688113e4a92910b6403fdd8ecb14fb0f3ce6a9/new.tex)). It does **not** yet
prove either paper's full stochastic existence, mean-field limit, or
propagation-of-chaos theorem. Those conclusions are neither axioms nor hidden
fields of a structure in this project.

This repository contains only the Lean verification. The paper is maintained
separately in [Carrying_Capacity_fixed](https://github.com/bobashopcashier/Carrying_Capacity_fixed).
The source snapshot is manuscript commit `c768811`; its `new.pdf` is identical
to the PDF supplied for formalization.

## Build and check

Install [elan](https://github.com/leanprover/elan), then run from this directory:

```sh
lake exe cache get
lake build
python3 scripts/check_proofs.py
```

`lean-toolchain` pins Lean **4.19.0**, and `lake-manifest.json` locks mathlib and
its dependencies. Mathlib is pinned to release `v4.19.0`, commit
`c44e0c8ee63ca166450922a373c7409c5d26b00b`. A compatible older release is used
deliberately so these proofs have a reproducible environment.

If the compiled cache helper cannot start on macOS, the equivalent interpreted
command is:

```sh
lake env lean --run .lake/packages/mathlib/Cache/Main.lean get
```

Open this folder in a Lean-enabled editor. Import `CarryingCapacity` to use all
modules. The proof audit checks the declarations for unsupported axioms and
rejects proof placeholders. The permitted foundational axioms are Lean's
`propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`; these are not assumptions about
the stochastic processes.

The complete build passed without warnings, and the exhaustive audit checked
**992 theorem declarations and 1,313 safe declarations across 39 modules**.
These counts include private helpers and compiler-generated declarations;
they are not counts of distinct results from the papers. Separate negative
checks confirmed that the audit rejects
custom project axioms and both public and private placeholder proofs.

The [paper map](docs/PAPER_MAP.md) identifies source statements and outstanding
proof dependencies. Some modules support both papers; others concern only
the extension. In particular, the original mean-field theorem allows weakly
convergent deterministic empirical initial laws without the extension's
uniform Lyapunov bound. It cannot be recovered merely by specializing κ to
the identity in a theorem that assumes those stronger moments. The original
boundary rule also suppresses births when the corresponding type is absent.

## Reading the central statements

The notation in the paper corresponds to:

| Paper | Lean |
|---|---|
| `E = ℕ₀ᴰ` | `State D` |
| `κ` with normalized discrete increments | `MomentScale` |
| `Kκ(x)` | `momentWeight κ x` |
| `ρκ(x,y)` | `adaptedDistance κ x y` |
| `Mκ(μ) = E[Kκ(X)]` | `moment μ` |
| `Wκ(μ,ν)` | `wasserstein μ ν` |
| `T_h x` | `Jump.advance h x` |
| `Vᴺ(z) = N⁻¹ Σᵢ Ψ(zᵢ)` | `FiniteGenerator.empiricalMean Ψ z` |
| Consistent stopped paths | `Freezing.ExitFamily` |

For example, `moment_difference_le_wasserstein` is proved by transporting
both moments to a coupling measure, bounding the integral of their absolute
difference by the integral of the adapted distance, and then taking the
infimum over all couplings. Nonemptiness of that set comes from an explicitly
constructed product coupling. Integrability is proved before the integral
inequalities are used.

`Freezing.ae_existsUnique_patch_of_exit_bounds` is a conditional but genuine
measure-theoretic result: reciprocal exit-probability bounds, monotone exit
times, and compatibility yield an almost-sure unique patch. It does not take
non-explosion as a hypothesis. The random frozen paths are now constructed
from the shared marked noise's measurable chronological event lists. Almost
surely, changing a valid dominating rate bound does not change the path, and
nested active sets give monotone actual exit times and stopped-path compatibility,
including the exit jump. The frozen paths are almost surely càdlàg and are
adapted to the filtration generated by arrived labelled
noise points. Finite-grid increments of the underlying exponential clock have
their full product Poisson law. The marked PRM characterization, compensation,
and exit bounds from the model's Lyapunov drift remain outstanding, as does
applying the patching theorem to those bounds.

`EmpiricalLLN.wasserstein_strongLaw` proves the full empirical transport strong
law using finite-state common-mass couplings and vanishing moment tails.
`EmpiricalMeanError` upgrades this to expected and time-integrated error
convergence under the manuscript's Lyapunov assumptions.
`ExchangeableMatching.exists_exchangeable_optimal_iid_coupling` constructs the
actual paired law while preserving both full vector marginals. It uses a fresh
uniform permutation of the matched pair array to obtain joint exchangeability.
`InitialCoupling.exists_initial_coupling` assembles that construction with the
proved uniform-integrability and LLN results: its expected pairing cost tends
to zero under the manuscript's initialization hypotheses. `EmpiricalArrayError`
transfers expected and time-integrated errors to finite iid arrays that vary
with N, without requiring those arrays to be initial segments of one sequence.

The quadratic coupling calculation includes the shared-jump contribution.
For a nonlinear κ, even a simultaneous birth can increase the distance;
controlling only unmatched jumps would miss this term.

## Remaining work for complete paper formalizations

1. Full marked PRM law, filtration increment independence, stopping-time and
   compensation results, Dynkin's formula, and Lyapunov exit estimates. The
   actual shared-noise frozen paths and their stopped compatibility are proved.
2. For the original theorem: Feller generation, the Markov empirical process,
   Yule domination, tightness, and convergence under its weaker initial data.
3. For the extension: deterministic-environment forward uniqueness, preservation
   of the Lyapunov curve space, Bielecki contraction, and the nonlinear fixed
   point. The moment-law space and candidate curve space are proved complete.
4. Derive localized process coupling, time-grid estimates, and path-space
   propagation of chaos from the proved initialization and empirical-error lemmas.

The Lean kernel checks the formal statements and proofs. Matching them to a
paper remains a mathematical review task, which is why the source map and
these scope distinctions are part of the deliverable.
