# Lean formalization of carrying-capacity mean-field models

**Status: partial formalization, with checked proofs and an explicit boundary.**
This project formalizes definitions and proof components from both
[DeWitt, Evans, Hiesmayr, and Hummel (2024)](https://arxiv.org/html/2307.06010v2)
and Kenny Xie's *Mean-Field Limits for Multitype Birth–Death Systems with
Unbounded Moment Feedback*
([manuscript source](https://github.com/bobashopcashier/Carrying_Capacity_fixed/blob/c7688113e4a92910b6403fdd8ecb14fb0f3ce6a9/new.tex)). It does **not** yet
prove either paper's full stochastic existence, mean-field limit, or
propagation-of-chaos theorem. Those conclusions are neither axioms nor hidden
fields of a structure in this project.

This repository contains only the Lean verification. The paper is maintained
separately in [Carrying_Capacity_fixed](https://github.com/bobashopcashier/Carrying_Capacity_fixed).
The source snapshot is manuscript commit `c768811`; its `new.pdf` is identical
to the PDF supplied for formalization.

## Build and check

Install [elan](https://github.com/leanprover/elan), then run from this directory:

```sh
lake exe cache get
lake build
python3 scripts/check_proofs.py
```

`lean-toolchain` pins Lean **4.19.0**, and `lake-manifest.json` locks mathlib and
its dependencies. Mathlib is pinned to release `v4.19.0`, commit
`c44e0c8ee63ca166450922a373c7409c5d26b00b`. A compatible older release is used
deliberately so these proofs have a reproducible environment.

If the compiled cache helper cannot start on macOS, the equivalent interpreted
command is:

```sh
lake env lean --run .lake/packages/mathlib/Cache/Main.lean get
```

Open this folder in a Lean-enabled editor. Import `CarryingCapacity` to use all
modules. The proof audit checks the declarations for unsupported axioms and
rejects proof placeholders. The permitted foundational axioms are Lean's
`propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`; these are not assumptions about
the stochastic processes.

The initial complete build and audit passed without warnings: **277 theorem
declarations and 435 safe declarations across 10 modules**. These counts include
private helpers and compiler-generated declarations, not 277 distinct results
from the papers. Separate negative checks confirmed that the audit rejects
custom project axioms and both public and private placeholder proofs.

## What is formalized

| File | Checked content | Boundary |
|---|---|---|
| [MomentGeometry](CarryingCapacity/MomentGeometry.lean) | Discrete κ scales; genuine adapted state metric; weight and ℓ¹ bounds; finite moment and Lyapunov sublevels | Does not prove probability-space completeness or Wasserstein–Orlicz results |
| [Transport](CarryingCapacity/Transport.lean) | Actual probability laws with integrable κ weight; actual marginal couplings; finite coupling costs; infimum transport cost, symmetry and zero self-distance; `\|Mκ(μ)−Mκ(ν)\| ≤ Wκ(μ,ν)` and consequent moment convergence | Does not establish the transport triangle inequality, identity of indiscernibles, completeness, or an empirical LLN |
| [Framework](CarryingCapacity/Framework.lean) | Multitype birth/death/mutation maps; invalid-jump convention; generator linearity; distinct original TV and extended moment assumptions | Assumption structures record hypotheses; they are not the main theorems |
| [RateControl](CarryingCapacity/RateControl.lean) | Every admissible jump has adapted length at least one; total rate is bounded by weighted activity; actual finite-configuration Lyapunov sublevels are finite | Gives deterministic finiteness needed for freezing, without constructing the driving random measures |
| [FiniteGenerator](CarryingCapacity/FiniteGenerator.lean) | Single-particle update identity; exact generator identity for empirical averages; averaged Lyapunov drift | Does not apply Dynkin's formula or construct a process |
| [Freezing](CarryingCapacity/Freezing.lean) | Finite-proposal recursion; one-jump enlargement; retaining the exit jump; permanent freezing; unique compatible patch; finite-horizon agreement; exit-tail bounds imply almost-sure exhaustion and patching | Requires the exit bounds and compatibility; does not derive them from a Poisson SDE or prove adaptedness of the patch |
| [Models](CarryingCapacity/Models.lean) | Scalar birth–death generator identities through cubic order; full three-term positive-increment coupling bounds; activity growth; cubic Lyapunov domination, drift and superlinearity; integrals of generator identities | Scalar model only; integrated identities are not time derivatives of stochastic expectations |
| [ModelTransport](CarryingCapacity/ModelTransport.lean) | Actual generalized moments control arbitrary nonnegative Lipschitz mortality; quadratic-feedback coupling and activity estimates follow from transport | Uses the concrete cubic Lyapunov choice, rather than every real exponent greater than two |
| [QuadraticModel](CarryingCapacity/QuadraticModel.lean) | Instantiates the actual single-type rates in `Framework`; proves `MomentCouplingBound` and `MomentActivityBound`; constructs `LyapunovControl` with `Ψ(x)=1+x³` for arbitrary nonnegative Lipschitz mortality | Checks the dynamic hypotheses of Proposition 7.7; initialization and the stochastic limit corollary remain outside this result |
| [LimitArguments](CarryingCapacity/LimitArguments.lean) | Successive population-then-cutoff limit; reciprocal cutoff specialization; three-region scalar criterion; counterexample to uncontrolled diagonal limits | Assumes the required estimates and tail limits, rather than asserting their stochastic derivation |

The [paper map](docs/PAPER_MAP.md) identifies source statements and outstanding
proof dependencies. Some modules support both papers; others concern only
the extension. In particular, the original mean-field theorem allows weakly
convergent deterministic empirical initial laws without the extension's
uniform Lyapunov bound. It cannot be recovered merely by specializing κ to
the identity in a theorem that assumes those stronger moments. The original
boundary rule also suppresses births when the corresponding type is absent.

## Reading the central statements

The notation in the paper corresponds to:

| Paper | Lean |
|---|---|
| `E = ℕ₀ᴰ` | `State D` |
| `κ` with normalized discrete increments | `MomentScale` |
| `Kκ(x)` | `momentWeight κ x` |
| `ρκ(x,y)` | `adaptedDistance κ x y` |
| `Mκ(μ) = E[Kκ(X)]` | `moment μ` |
| `Wκ(μ,ν)` | `wasserstein μ ν` |
| `T_h x` | `Jump.advance h x` |
| `Vᴺ(z) = N⁻¹ Σᵢ Ψ(zᵢ)` | `FiniteGenerator.empiricalMean Ψ z` |
| Consistent stopped paths | `Freezing.ExitFamily` |

For example, `moment_difference_le_wasserstein` is proved by transporting
both moments to a coupling measure, bounding the integral of their absolute
difference by the integral of the adapted distance, and then taking the
infimum over all couplings. Nonemptiness of that set comes from an explicitly
constructed product coupling. Integrability is proved before the integral
inequalities are used.

`Freezing.ae_existsUnique_patch_of_exit_bounds` is a conditional but genuine
measure-theoretic result: reciprocal exit-probability bounds, monotone exit
times, and compatibility yield an almost-sure unique patch. It does not take
non-explosion as a hypothesis. The outstanding step is constructing the
random frozen paths and deriving those exit-probability bounds from the
model's Lyapunov drift.

The quadratic coupling calculation includes the shared-jump contribution.
For a nonlinear κ, even a simultaneous birth can increase the distance;
controlling only unmatched jumps would miss this term.

## Remaining work for complete paper formalizations

1. Poisson random measures, frozen jump-by-jump construction, measurability,
   adaptedness, compensation, Dynkin's formula, and the Lyapunov exit estimates.
2. For the original theorem: Feller generation, the Markov empirical process,
   Yule domination, tightness, and convergence under its weaker initial data.
3. For the extension: completeness of the moment-transport flow space,
   deterministic-environment forward uniqueness, and the nonlinear fixed point.
4. Optimal initial pairing, iid empirical transport convergence, localized
   coupling estimates, time-grid estimates, and path-space propagation of chaos.

The Lean kernel checks the formal statements and proofs. Matching them to a
paper remains a mathematical review task, which is why the source map and
these scope distinctions are part of the deliverable.
